## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup for accessibility
- CSS custom properties (variables) for reusable styling
- Flexbox and media query for responsive layouts
- Scalable sizing using `rem` unit
- Interactive elements using `transition`, `cursor` styling and pseudo-classes (for `focus`, `hover` and `active` states)

### What I learned

**1. Keeping things organized**
  - Used CSS variables to easily change colors everywhere at once
  - Grouped similar styles together (like all font rules in one place)

**2. Responsive Design**
  - Made the card shrink properly on mobile screens using `@media` query
  - Used relative units (`rem`) with a `16px` base for consistent scaling

**3. User Experience**
  - Added smooth color changes when hovering on links
  - Designed focus states for keyboard users as well

**4. Practical Techniques**
  - `aspect-ratio` and `border-radius` kept my profile picture perfectly round
  - Used `gap` property so I don't have to calculate the margins of multiple elements
  - Linked local fonts because they load faster than Google web fonts

**5. Problem Solving**
  - Created own mockup using Figma since I only had access to the screenshot of the design
  - Fixed image stretching issues
  - Learned how to make transitions feel natural
  - Got better at using browser tools to test my design

### Continued development
- I faced challenges in accurately measuring elements and spacing since I only had a screenshot of the design to work with. Without access to the original Figma file, I had to recreate the entire layout manually in Figma.
- Fortunately, all those Figma tutorials and practice projects I did on my own really paid off. I was able to figure it out and finish my mockup on Figma.
- Iâ€™m planning to dive deeper into Figma to streamline my workflow. Mastering Figma will really help me create mockups faster and jump into coding more efficiently.
